#### Why start a blog?

I started this blog because I want to . . .
  - express myself 
  - get better at writing
  - learn more about stuff
  - share things I discover with others
  - practise what I learn in web development
  

Also, I started it because I really wanted to start something like this and see how it all turns out.



**\*\*** You may want to check out my [public Notion page](https://oorbeng.notion.site) if you're a medical student. Let me know if you find some of the stuff there useful.


#### How was this blog made?

I did not build everything from scratch; I only tweaked one or two things in [Sat Naing](https://github.com/satnaing)'s [AstroPaper](https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-paper/).
