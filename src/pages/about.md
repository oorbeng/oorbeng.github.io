#### Who am I?

My name is Wilfred.

I'm a Notion fan, I'm interested in programming with Python,and I also enjoy reading books, listening to podcasts and watching movies (dying out). 
I'm currently reading Medicine in school.

  <h4> Why s,tart a blog? </h4>

  <p>I started this blog because I want to . . .
    <ul>
      <li>express myself</li>
      <li>get better at writing</li>
      <li>learn more about stuff</li>
      <li>share things I discover with others</li>
      <li>practise what I learn in web development</li>
    </ul>

  Also, I started it because I really wanted to start something like this and see how it all turns out.

#### How was this blog made?

I did not build everything from scratch; I only tweaked one or two things in [Sat Naing](https://github.com/satnaing)'s [AstroPaper](https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-paper/).
