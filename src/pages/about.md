My name is Wilfred.

I've been using Obsidian a lot lately. I'm interested in programming with Python, and I enjoy reading books, listening to podcasts and watching movies. 
I'm currently reading Medicine in school.

#### Why start a blog?

I started this blog because I want . . .
  - to express myself 
  - to get better at writing
  -  to learn more about stuff
  -  to share things I discover with others
  -  to practice what I learn in web development
  

I also started this because I felt a desire to start something like this and see what happens.





#### How was this blog made?

I did not build everything from scratch; I only tweaked one or two things in [Sat Naing](https://github.com/satnaing)'s [AstroPaper](https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-paper/).
