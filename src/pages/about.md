#### Who am I?

My name is Wilfred.

I use Obsidian, I'm interested in programming and machine learning with Python, and I also enjoy reading books, listening to podcasts and watching movies (fading away).
I'm currently reading Medicine in school.

#### Why start a blog?

I started this blog because I want to

- express myself,
- get better at writing,
- learn more about stuff,
- share things I discover with others, and
- practise what I learn in web development.

Also, I started it because I really want to see how it will turn out.

#### How was this blog made?

I did not build this site from scratch; I made some changes to [Sat Naing](https://github.com/satnaing)'s [AstroPaper](https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-paper/).
