I said I was going to post weekly, but I didn't post anything last week. Sorry about that. I've not done much to be honest. My last update was posted a few days after my final exam for the academic year, and I guess I needed to take some time off to relax. I initially wanted to start work on an idea for a web app I had, so I planned to learn how to use some frontend frameworks, but I changed my mind. Web development doesn't really excite me.

**What I'm going to focus on**

What I'm interested in is machine learning, so I'm going to focus on that for now. [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) lists (1) Programming languages and data analysis tools, (2) Large-scale computation and the associated frameworks, and (3) Mathematics and statistics and how machine learning builds on it as pre-requisite knowledge for a good understanding of how machine learning algorithms work. After consulting a few blog posts and Reddit threads, I've decided to begin my learning journey with items one and three.

**What I'll be learning in the coming weeks**

Over the coming weeks, I'll be learning concepts in linear algebra, statistics, probability, and multivariate calculus (I hope I don't quit). For linear algebra, I will be studying Gilbert Strang's 'Introduction to Linear Algebra' and supplementing it with MIT's 18.06 course materials. Stanford's CS 109 will be my main guide for Probability, but I'm yet to settle on a book or course for statistics. I'll be following MIT's 18.02 course for multivariate calculus. 
I'll also be revisiting some Python topics and learning new ones alongside my math studies. I've come to know that project-based learning is the most effective way to truly learn a language and its tools, so that is what I'll be doing - working on projects.I will continue to document my progress in future posts.

PS: This and subsequent posts are a means to hold myself accountable throughout this learning journey. If you happen to have any advice or resource(s) that you believe would be helpful, please feel free to share with me.
