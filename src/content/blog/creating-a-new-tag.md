description: I'm adding 'devjourn' to my list of tags.

I was introduced to computer programming in senior high school by a good friend of mine. I am not an advanced programmer/developer. All I've done so far is play with a few Python libraries and frameworks, build some simple websites, and solve some HackerRank problems, but I enjoy it. I enjoy how easy it can be to turn an idea into reality, I enjoy fixing bugs, and I also enjoy using the keyboard keys that I wouldn't typically use. My learning hasn't been structured. What I've done these past few (very few) years mostly involved jumping between concepts, languages, and libraries, and I made the jumps when I felt free from school "duties". I want to change that. I want to learn more, and I want to write code regularly. I'll be posting weekly updates on my progress using the 'devjourn' tag.
