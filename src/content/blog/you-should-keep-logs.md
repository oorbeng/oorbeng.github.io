description: I prefer this to traditional journaling because it's quick and I experience less limbic friction.

Every week for me begins with a Google Keep note that bears the title of the week's number in relation to the year. This week's note, for example, is titled 'Week 8'. What goes into these notes as the week goes by are reminders, memories, ideas, and other expressions of thought and emotion.

All entries eventually end up in a larger note in my Obsidian workspace titled 'Logs'. I try to read every week's logs over the weekend. The real joy, however, comes when I revisit them at the end of the year.

These notes are, in a way, some form of a digital commonplace book, and I prefer this to traditional journaling because it's quick and I experience less limbic friction.

I started this practice two years ago, and it has become a habit. Every thought that comes to mind is followed by me picking up my phone and capturing it without delay.

I've found this habit worthwhile for several reasons. Some are that the timeline of thoughts and memories recorded allows me to see how and how much I change over time, and the ideas that are ambiently captured, upon exploration, can end up being seeds for projects. I think you should try it out.
