I told myself I would start a blog some time ago, and I am excited to be starting now. I will be sharing my thoughts and experiences, as well as anything interesting I discover and find worthy to share. But why start a blog? There are several reasons why I am embarking on this new journey, and I will be sharing them in this post.

I am starting this blog to improve my thinking and expressive abilities. I have read and heard many scholars emphasize the importance of writing for thinking. I believe that working on this blog regularly will make me more thoughtful and also help improve my use of the English language.

Another reason I am starting this blog is to learn more. Like many others, I am interested in a wide range of topics and want to use this as an opportunity to learn more about them. Some of the essays I will write for this blog will require some research, and I hope to learn more about the things I am interested in, as well as discover new interests along the way.

Practice makes perfect, and this is particularly true in web development. I learn some concepts in web development every now and then, and working on this blog is one of the ways I intend to practice what I learn. That said, don’t be surprised when you see changes in the design of the website the next time you visit.

One other reason why I am starting this blog is because I want to express myself more. I feel that I often have a lot to say but keep most of it inside, and I think that having a space where I can be myself and say what I have to say will be really helpful for me.

The above reasons are all true, but I think the truest of my reasons for starting this blog is simply the desire to create something—to start something and see what comes of it. Let's see how it all turns out.
