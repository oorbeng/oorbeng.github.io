When all is fair and the sun is high,  
My actions and utterances  
bring  gleeful sighs to the recipient,  
And her smile widens like a blooming flower,  
Her eyes, with joy, even tear up—  
Make me grateful for these cherished ties.

[2]

When the flame dims and darkness looms,  
My actions and utterances  
cut off the recipient's stream of joy,  
And her smile fades like a drooping flower,  
Tears spill from rueful eyes—  
Make me not defensive but quick in spirit,  
To reflect on my wrongs and apologize,  
Hoping to be forgiven.

[3]

When my heart skips with joy;  
Others’ kindness and company surround me,  
hearts shining bright,  
And butterflies take flight—  
Make me humble and thankful,  
For having a place in the few good hearts of others.

[4]

When my heart feels knifed, wounded sore,  
By others’ actions and words that cut to the core,  
And my mind clouded by pain and anger—  
Make me show mercy;  
May I find comfort in their apologies.  
And even if an apology is not given,  
May I find the strength to forgive,  
And move forward with grace.  
For holding onto anger and resentment,  
Only harms me in the end.
