They call me an "agenda" boy at times. They don't mean that I'm the kind of person who walks around with ulterior motives behind whatever I say or do (as may be suggested by dictionaries). Here, the term refers to a rather interesting kind of teasing. This kind of teasing isn't meant to provoke the other person, and it typically involves the comic use of hyperboles in comments about the person's behavior (or an event in their life). The people you subject to an "agenda" are often those you are close to - people you share some kind of vibe with. It usually ends with everyone laughing.

I've noticed that it brings people closer to each other (or at least I think so). I've also noticed that it disarms people and can be a great way to cheer someone up. However, these reasons aren't enough to explain why it's often impossible to resist engaging in it. I've thought about it before, but no obvious answers were revealed. Here I am, thinking about it again because it's among the random things that come up when I can't sleep. Why is it fun? Why is it impossible to resist at times?

Let me resume my attempts to sleep.
