description: Yes, I've started doing some math.

I have to be more consistent about when I write these. I've decided to stick with Fridays.

So, what have I learned since my last post? I've learned about vectors, vector dot and cross products, determinants, and parametric equations of lines and curves in multivariable calculus (Lectures 1 - 5 in MIT's 18.02). I got to know more about vectors, matrices, and how systems of linear equations could be solved using matrices from some sections in the first two chapters of Gilbert Strang's book, and I was introduced to the counting tasks and probability by Stanford's CS 109. I'm sure I spent more time on the calculus lectures, but I think I enjoyed the ones on probability the most.

I didn’t do much Python. Since the earlier post, I've gone back to look at exception handling, iterators, generators, namespaces, variable scopes, and some object-oriented programming concepts. I think namespaces are cool. I'll take a closer look at object-oriented programming over the weekend and start learning about data structures and algorithms in the following weeks. I want to spend the weekend trying my hand at problem sets and exercises related to what I've learned so far, so I won’t be watching any of the math lecture videos.

I think I have to make the Python projects a monthly thing.
